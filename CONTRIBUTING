STYLE
The preferred coding style for this repository, such as it is, is as follows:
- Javascript and CSS are limited to lines of 80 columns. This is to maintain
  readability when viewing many source files next to one another.
- Line limits do NOT apply to JSON or HTML, as the result would be ridiculous.
- Tabs for indentation.
- As it concerns line length limits, tabs count for 4 columns.
- In Javascript, prefer arrow functions, even at the top level, and use standard
  function syntax to denote instances in which "this" is meaningful.
- Strings that should be in single quotes include 'use strict', object
  subscripts, event and element types, and other strings that behave largely as
  symbols. Double quotes should be used for element properties (including IDs),
  strings meant for output, such as contents of HTML or snippets of CSS syntax,
  and other strings not directly tied to control flow.
- Prefer template strings to concatenation, though exercise judgment as to
  readability.
